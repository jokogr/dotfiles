# JoKo's dotfiles

This is my main repository of the dotfiles I use on various systems. I use
[homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick) to keep my dotfiles
up-to-date.

## Installation

In order to bootstrap directly, run the following command:
```text
curl -sL https://bitbucket.org/joko/dotfiles/raw/master/bootstrap.sh \
| /bin/bash -ex
```
